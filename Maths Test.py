# A primary school teacher wants a computer program to test the basic arithmetic skills of her students. 
# Generate random questions (2 numbers only) consisting of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
# The system should ask the studentâ€™s name and then ask ten questions. The program should feed back 
# if the answers are correct or not, and then generate a final score at the end.
