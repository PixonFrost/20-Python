#A simple classification system asks a series of Yes/No questions in order to work out what type of 
# animal is being looked at.

# Eg Does it have 4 legs? Does it eat meat? Does it have stripes?

# These systems can often be drawn using a “tree” structure. Carry out some simple research on 
# classification trees, then write a program to help the user decide between the following:

# horse, cow, sheep, pig, dog, cat, lion, tiger, whale, dolphin, seal, penguin, ostrich, sparrow, spider, 
# ant, bee, wasp, termite, octopus, squid

# Is there a better way to do this than using 101 IF...ELSE...END IFs?

# Develop your classification system for your own area of interest: pop bands; pokemon; cars; footballers; 
# teachers; diseases etc.
